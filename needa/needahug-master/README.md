# Need a hug? ![Minimum API](https://img.shields.io/badge/min.%20API%20level-15-blue.svg) ![Makes people smile](https://img.shields.io/badge/makes%20people-smile-green.svg)

An app that gives you *a virtual hug* every time you click on the button.

I created it as a part of [Google EU Scholarship - Android Development for Beginners](https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships). It was the first Android app I've ever made. 

During the last 3 months I documented all my progress on Udacity's forum. ******I decided to publish my old posts [here](https://github.com/anna-wro/needahug/wiki) for future reference******.
